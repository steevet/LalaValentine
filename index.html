    <h1>Hey Lala ❤️</h1>

    <p class="love-text">
      You’re the funniest person I know, the kind of funny that instantly
      makes my day brighter without even trying.
    </p>

    <p class="love-text">
      You’re incredibly smart, kind, and thoughtful, and the way you care
      about people genuinely inspires me. Your beauty still leaves me in awe
      every single time I see you. You get more beautiful with each passing day.
    </p>

    <p class="love-text">
      And your beautiful smile always makes my day. I could be having the worst day,
      but the moment I see that smile, everything feels okay again.
      I’m really glad to be with you, and I’m grateful for you every day.💖
